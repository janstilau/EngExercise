Her dancing also attracted the attention of French poets and painters of the period,
for it appealed to their liking for mystery, their belief in art for art’s sake, a
nineteenth-century idea that art is valuable in itself rather than because it may have
some moral or educational benefit, and their efforts to synthesize form and
content.

本句的难点在于能看出their liking for mystery , their belief in art for art’s sake 和their
efforts to synthesize form and content 并列，并且能够准确理解它们的含义。
遇到这样一个句子先顺着往下读，单个理解每一个意群的含义，并且能够把各部分意思串联
起来。这需要考生对同位语从句有一个理解，并且能够明白because 引导的从句具体是在
解释什么原因。看到their belief in art…前面没有连接词，就要预先想到是不是并列还没有
结束，到句子末尾时能联系前面的内容，知道and their efforts 就是和前面的their belief
in art…并列。

她的舞蹈还吸引了那一时期的法国诗人和画家的关注，因为它符合他们对神秘事物的喜爱，
符合他们为艺术而艺术的信仰（19 世纪的一种观念，即艺术本身具有宝贵的价值，而不是
因为它可能在道德或者教育上具有某种益处而具有价值），以及他们为形式和内容综合在一
起而付出的努力。

The people of the Netherlands, with a long tradition of fisheries and mercantile
shipping, had difficulty in developing good harbors suitable for steamships:
eventually they did so at Rotterdam and Amsterdam, with exceptional results for
transit trade with Germany and central Europe and for the processing of overseas
foodstuffs and raw materials (sugar, tobacco, chocolate, grain, and eventually oil).

有着悠久历史传统的渔业和航运业的荷兰人，在建造适合汽船停靠的优良海港上遇到难题：
在鹿特丹和阿姆斯特丹他们终于做到了，同时取得了杰出的成果，他们与德国和中欧地区进
行贸易运输，而且对海外食品和原材料进行加工（从糖类、烟草、巧克力、粮食到原油）。


本句的难点在于句子的修饰成分比较复杂，句子主干淹没在长长的定语和状语中。遇到这种
句子只需要理清各个成分的修饰关系，就算定语和状语很长，找到了句子主干和修饰关系，
句子意思也就明朗了。这里需要分清楚定语和状语的区别，定语修饰的是名词性的成分，一
般紧挨着被修饰词（比如，results for transit trade…，for transit trade 修饰的是results），
而状语则修饰非名词性成分，而且位置比较灵活，放在句首、句中或者句尾都不影响句子含
义。

The geologic timescale is marked by significant geologic and biological events,
including the origin of Earth about 4,6 billion years ago, the origin of life about 3,5
billion years ago, the origin of eukaryotic life-forms (living things that have cells
with true nuclei) about 1,5 billion years ago, and the origin of animals about 0,6
billion years ago.


地质年代表是以重大地质事件和生物事件为标记，包括46 亿年前地球的起源；35 亿年前
生命的起源；15 亿年前真核生物的出现（真核生物的细胞中含有完整的细胞核）；以及6
亿年前动物的起源。



In lowland country almost any spot on the ground may overlie what was once the
bed of a river that has since become buried by soil; if they are now below the
water’s upper surface (the water table), the gravels and sands of the former
riverbed, and its sandbars, will be saturated with groundwater.


在位于低地的国家中，几乎任何地点都有可能是覆盖在曾经的河床上方的地层，后来河床被
土壤所掩埋；如果以前的那些河床和它们的沙堤现在位于地下水位之下，它们中所含的碎石
和沙粒之间一定会充满着地下水。


Normally, the constantly changing levels of an animal's activity-sleeping, feeding,
moving, reproducing, metabolizing, and producing enzymes and hormones, for
example- are well coordinated with environmental rhythms, but the key question is
whether the animal's schedule is driven by external cues, such as sunrise or sunset,
or is instead dependent somehow on internal timers that themselves generate the
observed biological rhythms.

通常来讲，动物活动不断变化的程度——例如睡觉、进食、移动、繁殖、新陈代谢活动，
以及分泌酶和荷尔蒙——都能很好与自然规律一致，但是问题的关键在于，动物活动的时
间安排是由外界提示（比如日出或者日落）所驱使的，还是由自身内部的时钟以某种方式所
决定的（这种内部时钟自身形成一种生物节律，并且该生物节律已经被观测到）。

 
The fact that some societies domesticated animals and plants, discovered the use
of metal tools, became literate, and developed a state should not make us forget
that others developed pastoralism or horticulture (vegetable gardening) but
remained illiterate and at low levels of productivity; a few entered the modern
period as hunting and gathering societies
