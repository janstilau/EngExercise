The argument that humans, even in prehistoric times, had some number sense, at
least to the extent of recognizing the concepts of more and less when some objects
were added to or taken away from a small group, seems fair, for studies have shown
that some animal possess such a sense.

The biggest and brightest galaxies in the universe are elliptical with masses of
about 1013 times that of the Sun; these giants may frequently be sources of strong
radio emission, in which case they are called radio galaxies.

The residence time is an average; the time spent in the lake by a given molecule (if
we could follow its fate) would depend on the route it took: it might flow through
as part of the fastest, most direct current, or it might circle in a backwater for an indefinitely long time.

The researchers Peter Ucko and Andree Rosenfeld identified three principal

Contrary to the conclusions of Thor Heyerdahl's Kon-Tiki expedition of 1946, 状语 the
evidence of plant dispersal, archaeology, linguistics, and genetics now shows quite
conclusively that the Pacific Islands were not populated from the east by South
Americans who drifted on balsa-wood rafts and the prevailing wind and current,
but from the west, by groups from mainland Asia who gradually spread from island
to island out into the Pacific.

与Thor Heyerdahl's Kon-Tiki 在1946 年远征中得到的结论不同，植物传播的证据、考古
学、语言学和遗传学目前确凿地证明了，在太平洋岛屿上定居的人不是那些乘着轻木筏靠盛
行风和洋流漂流而至，来自于东方的南美人，而是那些逐渐从一个岛屿到另一个岛屿扩散到
太平洋上，来自于西方的亚洲大陆人群。


When the prairies were being settled, undoubtedly, the good economic conditions
of the 1950's supported a growth in the population, but the expansion also derived
from a trend toward earlier marriages and an increase in the average size of
families.



In Europe it took a little longer, mainly because there were more small producers
for whom the costs of sound were prohibitive, and in other parts of the world
problems with rights or access to equipment delayed the shift to sound production
for a few more years (though cinemas in major cities may have been wired in order
to play foreign sound films).

欧洲要稍晚一些，主要因为欧洲有更多的小型制片人，他们无法负担过于高昂的音效成本，
而且，在世界其他地方，版权问题以及获取设备的问题使得制作有声电影这一转变延误了很
多年（尽管很多大城市的电影院为了播放外国有声电影可能已经为设备接通了电源）。
