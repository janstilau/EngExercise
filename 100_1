In a countercurrent exchange system, the blood vessels carrying cooled blood from
the flippers[定语] run close enough to the blood vessels carrying warm blood from
the body[定语] to pick up some heat from the warmer blood vessels; thus, the heat
is transferred from the outgoing to the ingoing vessels before it reaches the flipper
itself.

If the pores are large, the water in them will exist as drops too heavy for surface
tension to hold, and it will drain away; but if the pores are small enough, the water
in them will exist as thin films, too light to overcome the force of surface tension
holding them in place; then the water will be firmly held.

The images produced by the camera obscura, a boxlike device that used a pinhole

were already familiar — the device had been much employed by topographical
artists like the Italian painter Canaletto in his detailed views of the city of Venice.

A maritime code known as the Consulate of the Sea which originated in the western
Mediterranean region in the fourteenth century, won acceptance by a majority of
sea goers as the normative code for maritime conduct; it defined such matters as
the authority of a ship's officers, protocols of command, pay structures, the rights of

In the 1970s when the study of Australian archaeology was in an exciting phase of
development, with the great antiquity of rock art becoming clear ,
Lesley Maynard
the archaeologist who coined the phrase “Panaramitee style,” suggested that a
sequence could be determined for Australian rock art in which a geometric style
gave way to a simple figurative style that, unlike the pan-Australian geometric
tradition tended to much greater regional diversity.

By contrast, in the United States an estimated 97 million birds are killed each
year when they collide with buildings made of plate glass; 57 million are killed
on highways each year; at least 3.8 million die annually from pollution and
poisoning; and millions of birds are electrocuted each year by transmission and
distribution lines carrying power produced by nuclear and coal power plants.

While accepting that this sequence fits the archaeological profile of those sites,
which were occupied continuously over many thousands of years a number of
writers have warned that the underlying assumption of such a sequence—a
development from the simple and the geometric to the complex and
naturalistic—obscures the cultural continuities in Aboriginal Australia in which
geometric symbolism remains fundamentally important.

Wild life zoologist Hulmut Buechner(1953), in reviewing the nature of biotic
changes in Washington through recorded time, says that "since the early 1940s,
the state has had more deer than at any other time in its history, the winter
population fluctuating around approximately 320,000 deer (mule and
black-tailed deer), which will yield about 65,000 of either sex and any age
annually for an indefinite period".
